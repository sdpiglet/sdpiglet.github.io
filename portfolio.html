	<img src="Images/weather.png" height="400" alt="clouds" class="aligncenter">
	<h3>This App randomly generates the weather each time and it has a sun, rain, and snow animation as well as a randomly generated cloud function</h3>
	<h3>The app asks the user to guess the weather and then afterwards, generates the actual weather, which could be sunny, rainy, cloudy, or snowy</h3>
	<h3>Each of these animations are different, with the clouds being a static image, the sun having moving rays, and the rain and snow being moving turtles that fall, representing rainfall and snowfall</h3>
