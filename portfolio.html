    <h1> Weather App</h1>
	<img src="Images/weather.png" height="400" alt="clouds" class="aligncenter">
	<h3>This App randomly generates the weather each time and it has a sun, rain, and snow animation as well as a randomly generated cloud function</h3>
	<h3>The app asks the user to guess the weather and then afterwards, generates the actual weather, which could be sunny, rainy, cloudy, or snowy</h3>
	<h3>Each of these animations are different, with the clouds being a static image, the sun having moving rays, and the rain and snow being moving turtles that fall, representing rainfall and snowfall</h3>

    	<h3>We analyzed the data from the sensors from the Rover and determined that it is likely in the desert plains due to the readings from the gyroscope, temperature sensor, sound sensor, and light sensor</h3>
	<h3>The desert plains has desert temperatures and constant winds with random alien creatures noises, which matches the graphs and the sensor data</h3>

    <h1>Ant Simulation</h1>
	<h3>The ant simulation simulates ants foraging for foods with pheromones and the user can change the evaporation rate of the pheromones.</h3>
	<h3>The ants movement is generally random which allows it to be a good model with sufficient randomness and chance in the model</h3>
